-- MF-3 (QĐ-110r, SPEC MF3-C.2): a departure recorded while the grace of a transfer lasts takes over the old rights, and the transfer is closed as
-- superseded by that departure. Expand only: one nullable column, one check, one function replaced; nothing is dropped and no row changes. Safe to
-- run twice.
--
-- `superseded_by_case_id` names the departure that took the transfer over. A transfer superseded is a transfer closed by the system, so the column
-- only exists beside a closing by the system on a transfer that took effect (each column asked on its own: a CHECK passes on NULL).

-- The guard of 20261113001800 with the column of the closing added: until a transfer that took effect closes, only the columns the settlement
-- writes change (the grace, the reminder, the snapshots, the closing, and the departure that took it over); the grace and the snapshots are
-- written once. A closed transfer, like a cancelled one, never changes again, with one exception: a transfer a departure superseded opens again,
-- whole, when that departure is cancelled (`QĐ-110r`, MF3-C-R5) -- the closing is undone and nothing else changes. A transfer that waits changes as
-- before.
