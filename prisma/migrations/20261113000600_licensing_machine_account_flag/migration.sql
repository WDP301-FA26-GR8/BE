-- QĐ-110m, R-9 (X-SA.1a): no service account any more. An IT Admin keeps one personal seat of a subscription for their own work (INV-02)
-- and may hold, on the same subscription, a seat they flag as "used for a machine account" (a pipeline, a bot, a shared tool login), which is
-- an ordinary personal seat with a flag. This migration only prepares the ground: the flag and its note, the INV-02 constraint that leaves
-- a flagged seat out, and the source of the rows the next migrations write. It moves no data (`_licensing_service_accounts_converted` does,
-- after the values it needs); it must run before that one so the converted rows are accepted. Forward only: nothing is dropped or deleted.

-- 1. The flag and the reason for it. The note is the reason the seat is a machine account, read by the IT Admin who answers for it; it is
-- present exactly when the flag is on (a flagged seat without a reason says nothing). Each column of the check is tested on its own
-- (`IS NOT NULL`): a check passes on NULL. Only a personal seat carries the flag; a service account row (kept as history) never does.

-- 2. INV-02 (R-9): a person is not on one subscription twice at once with a personal seat, a seat flagged as a machine account apart. The
-- flag is a column of the row, so a seat that is flagged or unflagged later is judged again by the constraint on that update: turning the
-- flag off while the person holds another personal seat of the subscription for an overlapping period is refused (23P01).

-- use (IDENTIFIER_IN_USE), as it was while this constraint was the older of the two. Dropping and adding it above made it the younger, so the
-- constraint on the identifier is created again after it, as it was created (20261020190100). Same definition, same rows.
