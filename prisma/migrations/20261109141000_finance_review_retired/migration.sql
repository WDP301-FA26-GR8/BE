-- BR-MF1-06g, QĐ-97c: there is no review of Finance, no question to Finance, no override and no wait for a budget any more (Q-26: simple data
-- migration, no judgement preflight; the demo is seeded again). What waits for Finance goes back to the queue of the head, where the check runs
-- when the head sends it on. Nothing is dropped (RV-15): the enum values and the old tables stay readable, and a CHECK refuses a NEW row that
-- uses them (NOT VALID looks at new and changed rows only). No grant to the runtime role here (RV-28).

-- 1. A request that waits for a review of Finance or for a budget, or that waits (under control) on a review nobody can hold, is back in the
-- queue of its head. The steps are read before they are closed.
UPDATE "access_requests" r
   SET "state" = 'AWAITING_SPEND_SUBMISSION'
 WHERE r."state" IN ('AWAITING_FINANCE_REVIEW', 'AWAITING_BUDGET')
    OR (r."state" = 'WAITING_CONTROLLED'
        AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM "access_request_steps" s
                     WHERE s."request_id" = r."id" AND s."kind" = 'FINANCE_REVIEW' AND s."state" IN ('PENDING', 'WAITING')));

-- 2. A review that is open is closed without an outcome (a step that ended without a decision is CLOSED); the question of the approver to Finance
-- that is open is closed with it.
UPDATE "budget_information_requests"
   SET "state" = 'CLOSED', "closed_at" = now(), "close_reason" = 'STEP_CLOSED'

UPDATE "access_request_steps"
   SET "state" = 'CLOSED', "waiting_reason" = NULL, "decided_at" = now()
 WHERE "kind" = 'FINANCE_REVIEW' AND "state" IN ('PENDING', 'WAITING');

-- 2b. A late need step is told to its holder and to the person who asked for the request, and to nobody above them (QĐ-100j). The value is not
-- used in this migration (a new enum value cannot be).
ALTER TYPE "SlaReminderRole" ADD VALUE 'REQUESTER';
