# Containers and migrations

Compose provides local PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO. Ports bind to loopback.
Check for port conflicts before starting; do not stop unrelated services.
Create the configured MinIO bucket before using storage.

MinIO builds locally from the pinned official release because the old prebuilt image
cannot be pulled. The first build downloads Go dependencies and can take several minutes.
This is a local development service; review storage support/security separately for production.
[Official source-build instructions](https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z).

For port conflicts set POSTGRES_PORT, REDIS_PORT, MINIO_PORT and MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT
in your shell/.env, and align DATABASE_URL/OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT with those host ports.

Dockerfile builds the generated Prisma client in Linux, installs dependencies from
the lockfile and runs the final image as the node user. Secrets, local node_modules
and generated output are excluded from the build context.

```sh
docker build -t slm-api:foundation .
docker build --target migrate -t slm-migrate:foundation .
```

The runtime defaults to production. Supply DATABASE_URL, HTTPS CORS_ORIGINS,
REDIS_HOST/REDIS_PASSWORD, HTTPS OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT and storage credentials/bucket.
Authentication also requires AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, AUTH_THROTTLE_PEPPER and secure cookies;
invitation delivery requires HTTPS APP_PUBLIC_URL, OUTBOX_PAYLOAD_KEY (base64 of 32 bytes),
OUTBOX_PAYLOAD_KEY_ID, SMTP_HOST, SMTP_FROM and SMTP_TLS=true, plus the provider's port/auth settings.
The [environment validator](../../src/infrastructure/config/env-schema.ts) owns the full constraints.
The API and the worker validate all of these settings and refuse to start in production without them.
The installation command validates only the database settings and NODE_ENV (see below).
Use container-reachable hostnames: localhost means the container itself.

Create untracked environment files appropriate to the target environment:

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file .env.migration slm-migrate:foundation
docker run --rm --env-file .env.container -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 slm-api:foundation
```

The migration image requires DATABASE_URL with migration privileges. The runtime
does not run migrations automatically. The baseline is for a fresh database;
existing databases need a separately reviewed transition, never an automatic reset.
First-run installation (once, on an empty database after migrations) is an interactive command in the
same runtime image: `docker run --rm -it --env-file .env.container slm-api:foundation node dist/installation-cli.js --help`.
The command validates only `NODE_ENV` (the image sets it to production), `DATABASE_URL` (the runtime role)
and the optional `DB_*` limits; it does not read the JWT, SMTP, outbox, Redis, object-storage or `APP_PUBLIC_URL`
settings, so `docker run --rm -it -e DATABASE_URL=... slm-api:foundation node dist/installation-cli.js ...` is enough.
`--help` and argument errors do not touch the environment at all. Passing the full env file still works;
unrelated variables are ignored. Exit code 1 does not prove that nothing was written: if the connection or the
reply to `COMMIT` was lost, check the installation state before running it again (a rerun that exits 2 means the
first run committed).
It needs a terminal (`-it`) because the Super Admin password is typed at a hidden prompt; it refuses to
read it from arguments, the environment or a pipe. The consolidated
[G0/G1 review](../reviews/g0-g1-remediation-2026-10-15/README.md) records the Linux PTY verification
through the remediation revision; manual interactive PowerShell verification is still pending.
The worker uses the same runtime image with command `node dist/worker.js` and runs the PostgreSQL
outbox polling loop for SMTP delivery. No BullMQ processor is registered. Compose has no SMTP sink;
configure a reachable SMTP service separately. SMTP TLS/provider delivery remains unverified.

For a local container smoke test, explicitly set NODE_ENV=development, database and
service hostnames; do not expose development credentials to a shared environment.
Health live checks the HTTP process; ready pings PostgreSQL only and answers 503 `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` when it fails.
Behind PgBouncer or a managed pooler the connection startup parameters `options` and
`idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` need attention: see the pooler note in
[ARCHITECTURE](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) (not verified with any pooler).
