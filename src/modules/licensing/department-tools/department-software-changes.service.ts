 * that is already listed, or an entry that is not in this department, refuses the whole call and nothing is written. The unique index decides a
 * duplicate (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` says what was written), so two IT Admins who add the same place together leave one entry and a refusal for
 * the other. The department is held `FOR SHARE` until commit. Each place added or taken out is one event of the Audit Trail, without its note.
