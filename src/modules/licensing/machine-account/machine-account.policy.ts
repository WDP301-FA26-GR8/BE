 * seat (a service account of the earlier releases is history, never flagged); it is open; and, to turn the flag on, the person who holds
 * it is an IT Admin who can act. Turning it off asks nothing of the holder: a person who stopped being an IT Admin must be able to give
 * the flag up. Null when the change may be made; whether the person holds another personal seat of the subscription for an overlapping
 * period is judged by the database (INV-02), not here.
 *
 * Open (review of X-SA): the seat did not fail, was not cancelled, and its end day, if it has one, is after `today` in the calendar of the
 * organization (the period is `[effectiveFrom, validUntil)`, so a seat that ends today is over). A seat set to end later is still held and
 * may be flagged: the seat the conversion migration writes keeps the end its service account had, and a seat that ends by itself is no
 * reason to refuse the flag to the bot that uses it until then.
