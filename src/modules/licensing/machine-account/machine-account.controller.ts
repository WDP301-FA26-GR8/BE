/**
 * The flag "used for a machine account" of the personal seat of an IT Admin (`QĐ-110m`, `R-9`). There is no service account any more: a
 * pipeline, a bot or a shared login is a seat of an IT Admin with this flag on, which INV-02 leaves out, so the IT Admin keeps their own
 * personal seat of the same subscription as well. A seat is never created here: the flag is put on a seat that was granted, and the grant
 * of a second personal seat of one subscription is refused by INV-02 before the flag exists.
