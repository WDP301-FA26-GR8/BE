/**
 * What approval does to a request for the renewal of a right (`US-05-14` AC-1, `BR-MF1-08d`): approval does not extend the right. In the
 * transaction of the decision that completed the approval (the need step of a request that costs nothing, the spend step of one that costs
 * money) an IT task of the kind EXTEND is opened on the seat (`requestExtension`), and the request waits for it in `AWAITING_EXECUTION`;
 * the right is held as it is meanwhile, even past its end (the renewal is pending). When the IT Admin completes the task, licensing asks
 * this module to apply it (`apply`): the record that follows the old one is written (the old one is not edited), the request is completed
 * and the record is named on it. When the seat can no longer be renewed (it ended, or its end changed, or it is being revoked) the request
 * fails, what was held for it goes back to the budget, and the approval already written stays: nobody decides again. The request is
 * locked by the caller.
