/**
 * The limits of a request for new access, judged per beneficiary (`BR-MF1-01`, `QĐ-103c`, `QĐ-104b`, `QĐ-108c`). A pure rule: the
 * caller reads the facts (under the lock of the person when it sends) and refuses or records what this answers.
 *
 * - GH-1 (`BR-MF1-01e`): a person who holds the plan, or has a request for new access of the plan open, cannot ask for it again. The
 *   seat held is judged by the caller (`ALREADY_HOLDS_ACCESS`, as before); the open request is judged here.
 * - GH-2 (`BR-MF1-01f`): a person who already has `openLimit` requests for new access open cannot be named in another one.
 * - GH-3 (`BR-MF1-01g`): a person who already uses `paidThreshold` paid applications or more may still ask, with a reason, and the
 *   request is flagged; asking for another plan of an application they already use adds nothing, so it is not flagged (M-16).
 *
 * A request for a renewal, for a service account, or a request again exempt by `QĐ-108c` or the overlap of a transfer is not judged
 * by GH-1/GH-2.
