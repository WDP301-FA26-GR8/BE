/**
 * What the grant of a seat asks of the module of requests (`GrantRequestGate`, registered with licensing when the module
 * starts). The request is locked inside the transaction of the grant and moved to EXECUTING there, which is what lets it
 * be granted once; the outcome of the task moves it to COMPLETED or FAILED in the transaction that ends the task. The
 * system, not a person, makes these moves: the person is the IT Admin of the task, whose own audit event names them. A
 * request whose requester withdrew while the grant had failed waits (`AWAITING_IT_CLOSE`) for the IT Admin to cancel the
 * task, which ends it as withdrawn (`US-05-08` AC-9).
