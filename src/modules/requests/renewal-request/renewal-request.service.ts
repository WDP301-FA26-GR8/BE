/**

 * kind RENEWAL, for the same tool and the person who holds it, and it is decided like any request (the need step, and for paid
 * software the spend step and its commitment). Sent up to the end of the right (today counts), the right is left as it is until a
 * decision comes (`AC-4`); sent after it, what is made is a request for the tool like any other, not a renewal (`AC-5`). The seat
 * is locked first, so two requests for one seat leave one. Approval is `RenewalApplyService`'s. Neither the
 * reason nor the identifier of the account enters an audit event.
