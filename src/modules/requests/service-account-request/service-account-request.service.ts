/**
 * Sending a request for a service account (`US-05-21` AC-1, AC-2): the person asks for the account of a non-human subject
 * for themselves, and answers for it. It is the same request as any other, so the facts it is judged by are read by the same
 * `RequestAssessmentService`, and every step after it (the need, the spend, the commitment) is the one of the plan: the
 * department and Unit Cost Center are those of the sender on the day, the branch and the chain come from the kind of the
 * application, and a paid plan always has its spend step whatever seats the subscription has left (`QĐ-82m` C). What is
 * particular is the detail (purpose, expected identifier, who answers) and the two rules of `submitRefusal`. The request,
 * its detail and its audit events are written in one transaction, so a refused request leaves nothing behind. Neither the
 * purpose nor the identifier enters an audit event.
