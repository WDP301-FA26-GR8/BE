 * Two moments that close the transfer of a person who moved (`QĐ-110r`, SPEC MF3-C.2), both added to an extension point when the module starts so
 * `licensing` never imports `personnel`:
 *
 * - the end of a task of revocation of the person (`RevocationListeners`, `AFTER_WORK` with the status `COMPLETED`): this may be the last right of the
 *   old department, so the transfer is asked to close (`TransferClosureService.closeIfDue`). It runs in the transaction of the completion, which
 *   already holds the task, the subscription and the seat, so it takes the transfer `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and never waits for one that another
 *   command holds: the hourly pass of the sweep then closes it.
 * - the record of a departure (`PersonnelFileHookContributions`, `onRecorded` of an `OFFBOARDING` file): a transfer still in its grace is closed as
 *   superseded by that case, and the departure's own revocations take the old rights back (`TransferClosureService.supersede`).
 * - the cancellation of that departure (`onCancelled`): the transfer it superseded opens again, unless the person was moved again since
 *   (`TransferClosureService.reopenSuperseded`); nothing is taken back, the sweep does it when the grace is over.
