 * the grace may ask again, as a new request in the new department, for software they are about to lose: the request is let through the check of the
 * seat held and the count of the limits (GH-2; a duplicate of the plan stays refused), and names the old right it replaces. Only the personnel context knows a grace, so the requests open an extension
 * point and this adds itself to it when the module starts (ADR-0019: a lower module that needs a higher one opens a point, the higher binds it).
 * The last day of the grace is still the grace. A right begun after the day the transfer took effect belongs to the new department and is not one.
