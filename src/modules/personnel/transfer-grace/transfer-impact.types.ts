 * alike, with the day the grace ends in place of the day the revocations are due.
 *
 * `responsibilities` is what an IT Admin who is moved answers for in the catalog (subscriptions and applications, `R-8`). `vendorAdminRoles` lists the plans they administer at the vendor (`QĐ-110k`). Not yet counted: the
 * commitment that the seats of the old department give back the day the
 * transfer takes effect (MF3-B.3 adds it to `commitmentToRelease`).
