 * of the grace, for every personal right held from the day the transfer took effect or before that is still in force, it asks the one gate of
 * licensing (`openRevocation`) for a revocation with the source `TRANSFER`, the system as the actor and the transfer as the reference, so the task is
 * in the queue of the IT Admin in charge of the new department (the department of the person today). Idempotent by the gate itself: asking again
 * for the same source and reference changes nothing, and a seat that has a live task of another source is given the reason besides, never a second
 * task (`provisioning_tasks_one_live_revocation_per_assignment`). A right that was asked for again on the same subscription in the grace was ended by the
 * grant (R-49) and is no longer in force, so it is left out by what it is, not by a list.
 *
 * Each transfer has a transaction of its own that locks the employee, then the transfer, reads it again and acts; one that fails is logged and tried
 * again at the next pass without stopping the others. The picture of the rights is kept now for a transfer that took effect before the grace existed
 * (m-17), which has none, so the closing can say what became of each right.
