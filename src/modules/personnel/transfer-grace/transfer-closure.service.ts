 * - **A departure in the grace.** A departure recorded while the grace lasts takes the old rights over: MF-2 revokes them by its own deadline, so the
 *   transfer is closed as superseded by that case (`supersede`, `superseded_by_case_id`) and the sweep never opens a revocation for it.
 *
 * Done in the transaction of the caller, which holds the employee and the transfer. Closing twice is a no-op.
