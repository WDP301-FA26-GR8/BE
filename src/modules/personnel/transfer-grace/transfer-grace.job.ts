 * Once an hour looks after the transfers whose person moved and keeps the rights of the old department for a grace (`QĐ-110p`, `QĐ-110r`, SPEC
 * MF3-C.1): first tells the start of the grace to the people of a transfer from before the grace existed (m-17), then reminds the person who is
 * about to lose their rights, then takes the rights back when the grace is over. Each transfer has a transaction of its own that locks the employee,
 * then the transfer, and writes once (the reminder by `reminded_at`, the telling by the picture of the rights, the revocation by the gate of
 * licensing), so the hourly pass and every instance that runs it are safe; a work that fails as a whole only logs, the others still run in the same
 * pass, and the next pass tries again. The timer never keeps the process alive.
