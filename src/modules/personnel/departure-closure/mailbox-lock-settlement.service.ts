 * Writes the lock of the mailbox (1b) that the listener of the last K1 revocation could not write (`QĐ-110e`, `B-1`, SPEC P28, D-72). The
 * listener never waits for a case another command holds (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, D-66), so a revocation completed in that moment ticked the
 * lock and the system did not write it; nothing else would, and the case would stay open for good. This is the hourly pass that does: for the
 * departures that have (1a) and not (1b), it asks `licensing` which of the people have a completed K1 revocation that ticked the lock of the
 * mailbox (the checklist the revocation kept), and for each one writes (1b) by the system under the same rule as the listener (the person holds no
 * K1 seat without a completed revocation, `MailboxLockService.writeForSystemIfDue`), then closes the case if that was the last thing it waited for.
 * Each case has a transaction of its own that locks the employee, then the case `FOR UPDATE` (the lock protocol of the commands on a case): one
 * that fails is logged and tried again next time without stopping the others.
