/**
 * What the revocation of a seat tells the `G2`, `G3` or `G4` recommendation that holds it (`US-07-05` AC-12, AC-15; `DA6-02`): the module adds this
 * to licensing's `RevocationListeners` when it starts, so licensing never imports it. Only a task that is completed (the claim also
 * announces `AFTER_WORK`, with the task still in progress, and changes nothing here) and a task closed as failed matter. A
 * completed task whose seat ended closes the recommendation (`ACCEPTED` when the task carries its reason, else `SEAT_ENDED`), one whose
 * seat still holds (a K1 access that runs on) leaves it decided; a task closed as failed puts the `G2` back to open and leaves a `G3`/`G4`
 * the head decided as it is: the table says the reclaim is not done, and the IT Admin reclaims it again or returns it (`Q-95`, `DA6-02`).
 *
 * It runs in the transaction of licensing, which already holds the task, so it picks the recommendation `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and
 * never waits for one that another transaction holds: the daily run settles that one later from the status of its task (`DA6-23`).
