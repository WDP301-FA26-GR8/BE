 * a contract, then to the IT Admin and Finance. A link that opens a file is made when it is asked for, lives five
 * minutes, and is stored nowhere. The role is the one held at the moment of each request.

 * What the person uploads goes to a key the upload link can still write to, so it is never what is kept: once the stored
 * object is judged, those very bytes are copied to a key of their own that no link reaches, and the link is of no use to
 * replace them (`SEC-01`). A file whose upload never came is not refused, only waiting; after a day it is given up (`DB-13`).
