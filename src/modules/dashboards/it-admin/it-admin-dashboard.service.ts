/**
 * The overview of an IT Admin (`US-12-15` AC-4), in the scope the IT Admin works: the departments that name them in charge (and every
 * active one while nobody usable is named), the tasks and SaaS reports they are in charge of by default, as the queues call them "mine".
 * The open grant and revocation tasks, the open SaaS reports, the departures still handing over and the keys in the vault are counted;
 * the plan terms to review are listed by their own operation. `cancellationDeadlines` points at `subscriptionList`, which lists every
 * subscription and cannot filter by notice deadline: the client keeps the ones whose `noticeDeadline` is near (an open decision, see
 * `a10-it-admin-dashboard`); `subscriptionRenewalList` lists only the cases already proposed, so it is not the source either. The discrepancies
 * (people active in a vendor with no seat to cover the day, `FR-4.8`) are the open findings of the vendor usage import; the company machines whose holder has not
 * acknowledged the notice are counted from the register of the organization (`unconfirmedDevices`, the total `deviceList` answers for that state). The recommendations of wasted seats are counted as the `G2` not closed plus the `G1` open of the whole organization (`ghostSeats`).
 * The progress of the departures and the transfers of those departments (`departures`, `transfers`), the seats of the shared pools got back in the tasks
 * the IT Admin is in charge of (`seatsReturned`) and the plans short of admins at the vendor (`plansBelowVendorAdminMinimum`) come from `DashboardProgressService`
 * (SPEC P21); `offboardingHandovers` stays one release beside them (the cases still handing over, as before) and is dropped after.
