/**
 * The overview of an IT Admin (`US-12-15` AC-4), in the scope the IT Admin works: the departments that name them in charge (and every
 * active one while nobody usable is named), the tasks and SaaS reports they are in charge of by default, as the queues call them "mine".
 * The open grant and revocation tasks, the open SaaS reports, the departures still handing over and the keys in the vault are counted;
 * the plan terms to review are listed by their own operation. `cancellationDeadlines` points at `subscriptionList`, which lists every
 * subscription and cannot filter by notice deadline: the client keeps the ones whose `noticeDeadline` is near (an open decision, see
 * `a10-it-admin-dashboard`); `subscriptionRenewalList` lists only the cases already proposed, so it is not the source either. The discrepancies
 * between sources (usage data) and the company machines without a confirmation (device registry) have no source yet: each says so and
 * never shows zero.
