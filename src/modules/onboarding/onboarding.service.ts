 * without a head or without an IT Admin in charge is a warning inside it and stops nothing (`QĐ-66d`). Steps 2 to 5
 * need the application catalogue, the subscriptions and the seats, which are not built yet, so they say so and step 4
 * says what it waits for; they join this checklist when those exist.
