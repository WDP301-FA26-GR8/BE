# Backend agent instructions

Scope: this backend repository. Work from its root with the pnpm version in `package.json`.

## Start here

- Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for workflow and verification commands.
- Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing module boundaries.
- Check the branch, working diff and relevant source/tests; preserve existing changes.
- Current runtime: health, `/auth/*`, `/me` plus infrastructure; first-run installation is a CLI
  (`pnpm ops:bootstrap`). Super Admin account administration (create, invite, activate, lock, role
  grants) is implemented as slice 1b and verified locally at `d60d306`; final acceptance is pending.
  Catalog is a structural sample and is not mounted.
  Password change/reset and all other US workflows are not implemented.

## Repository constraints

- Default to flat feature modules. A module with several distinct capabilities may group files by capability,
  with at most two directory levels, as documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Controllers map HTTP; services
  coordinate; `*.repo.ts` owns persistence.
- Cross-module calls use exported facades/contracts; never import another module's private files or query its tables.
- Keep framework-free primitives in `src/core`; technical adapters in `src/infrastructure`.
- Generated `src/generated/`, `dist/` and `openapi.json` change through their generators.
- Do not load every ADR, design document or external repository by default.
  Obtain the relevant requirement before inventing missing business behavior.
- For US design and implementation handoff, follow [shared planning](docs/workspace/README.md).
- Use pinned BRD/US revisions and the current spec/plan. The assignee owns design, implementation,
  tests and plan maintenance; peer review is optional, except where a pinned requirement, decision or spec
  explicitly requires it (for example the US-01-10 technical values) — then it is a recorded gate before
  `accepted`. Never invent Owner approval, peer review or acceptance.
- No specific AI vendor or external skill package is required. An AI that supports skills should follow
  the phase-specific guidance in [shared planning](docs/workspace/README.md); repository rules, pinned
  requirements, the current spec/plan and acceptance criteria remain authoritative.
- Multi-agent work is optional. Use it only for independent, clearly bounded tasks; one primary agent
  must own integration, final diff review and verification. Do not let agents edit the same files,
  operate on the same test database or perform Git publication concurrently.

## Verify and hand off

- Docs: `pnpm rules:check` and `pnpm rules:format`.
- Source/config: `pnpm check`; HTTP changes also require `pnpm test:e2e` and `pnpm openapi:export`.
- Database changes need the isolated integration setup in the test guide.
- Before handoff, self-review the final diff against the assigned spec/plan and AC; update affected
  operational documentation or runbooks. Report actual commands/results and unverified boundaries.
  Do not silently skip a failed gate.
- Keep secrets and real data out of artifacts. Do not commit, push, deploy or change shared data unless authorized.
