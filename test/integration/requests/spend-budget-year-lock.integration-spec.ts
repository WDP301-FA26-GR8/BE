/**
 * `g0-g6-final-business-baseline-remediation`, Task 4.3 (F31, spec F and K): the check of the budget of a request takes the transaction
 * lock of the Cost Center and the year of every year that binds, after the lock of the row of its request and in ascending order of year,
 * and computes only after it holds them, so that two requests of one Cost Center and year are judged one after the other and the second
 * reads what the first now holds. Deterministic: a holder keeps the lock in another connection, the calls queue one by one
 * (`waitForLockWaiters`), and the holder lets them go.
