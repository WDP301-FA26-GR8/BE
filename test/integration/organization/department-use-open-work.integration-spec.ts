 * F15 (`QĐ-90e`, spec B): licensing tells the organization which provisioning tasks are still open for a department, so that it cannot
 * be retired while seats of it are being granted or taken away. A task is open while it is queued, waiting for its retry, being worked
 * or failed; it belongs to the department that owns its seat, or, for a seat that carries none, to the owner of its subscription.
 * Read through `OrganizationApi.getDepartmentUse`, the way retiring a department reads it, on real PostgreSQL.
