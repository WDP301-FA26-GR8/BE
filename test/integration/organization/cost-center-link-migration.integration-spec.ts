/**
 * `g0-g6-final-business-baseline-remediation`, Task 1.1a (F01, reviews `P03-RV-03`/`P03-RV-04`, spec L.10 and L.11): the
 * migration `…_cost_center_department_link` is the compatibility step of `QĐ-87d(1)`: every Cost Center belongs to
 * exactly one department. It only adds and relaxes, so the `7c28e75` application — which charges a department to a Cost
 * Center through `departments.cost_center_id` and never writes the new columns — keeps working on the new schema: two
 * triggers keep the old column and the new link equal, and what `7c28e75` writes afterwards is either carried over or
 * listed by the live inventory of `ops:preflight`. Every statement that plays `7c28e75` is plain SQL on the old columns. The history
 * is deployed **through** this migration: the final migration after it removes the old column and the two triggers, so this is the
 * boundary the previous image runs on while it can still be the target of a recovery.
